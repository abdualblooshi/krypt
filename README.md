# Krypt

![Demo](https://i.imgur.com/10Kzlos.png)

Krypt is a Blockchain Application that uses Web 3.0 methodologies, Solidity and Metamask to **transfer Ethereum from an address to another**, the front-end uses Vite (React) and Tailwind CSS

(Please note that this just a development project and it's not used for **Production**, I simply made this to learn more about Web 3.0 and Blockchain)
